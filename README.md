# Lectio_Divina_Pythonista_App

This is an app that is designed to be used on the Pythonista iOS app. If you try to run this py script on a computer or android, be aware that the 'sound' module is unique to the Pythonista app and should be commented out.

This app walks you through a Lectio Divina session which audio cues when you should switch to the next step. I find it helpful to have timers instead of watching the clock to see how long you've been doing it.

You can make this Pythonista script into an icon for your ipad or iphone by googling 'set script to home screen in pythonista.' That way, all it takes is 1 click to start the program.
